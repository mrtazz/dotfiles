If your [commit message sucks](http://stopwritingramblingcommitmessages.com/),
I'm not going to accept your pull request.  I've explained very politely
dozens of times that
[my general guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
are absolute rules on my own repositories, so I may lack the energy to
explain it to you yet another time.  And please, if I ask you to change
something, `git commit --amend`.

Beyond that, don't be shy about asking before patching.  What takes you
hours might take me minutes simply because I have both domain knowledge
and a perverse knowledge of Vim script so vast that many would consider
it a symptom of mental illness.  On the flip side, some ideas I'll
reject no matter how good the implementation is.  "Send a patch" is an
edge case answer in my book.
