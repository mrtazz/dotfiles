# Minimal C++ program

Here is a minimal C++ program which prints "Hello world!":

```cpp
#include <iostream>
void main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello world!";
}
```

# Same again

Here's the same program, without the label on the fenced code block

```
#include <iostream>
void main()
{
  std::cout << "Hello world!";
}
```
