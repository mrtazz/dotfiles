```
#include <iostream>
```

It doesn't matter whether or not you label fenced code blocks with the language type:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
```

The opening triple-backtick must be preceded by a blank line. The closing triple-backtick must be followed by a blank line. Exceptions are made for fenced code blocks at the start or end of a file.

```
#include <iostream>
```
