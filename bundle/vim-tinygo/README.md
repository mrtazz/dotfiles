# vim-tinygo

Collection of vim settings for a minimal setup.

## Motivation

I used the vim plugin provided with the go distribution for a long time.
However it got discontinued and the "officially endorsed" plugin now is
[vim-go][vim_go]. It's an awesome one, and you should take a look at it.
However for me I just wanted to keep the tiny version of it with a small
manageable feature set. So I pulled out the things I want into some settings
in my vimrc. Eventually my vimrc got too big, so I decided to move all the
things into here.
