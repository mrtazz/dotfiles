# NAME

snipple â€” a simple snippet manager


# SYNOPSIS

`snipple list [--alfred]`

`snipple get <snippet>`



# EXAMPLES

`snipple list`
: Lists all snippets in the snippet directory.

`snipple get rust/test.snippet`
: Prints the `rust/test.snippet` snippet from the snippet directory.


# DESCRIPTION

`snipple` is a command line utility to manage reusable snippets of text. The
core idea is that snippets should just be text files in a directory structure
that can be managed within a filesystem. This enables a flexible way of
interacting and managing snippets via e.g. syncing with cloud services or
tools like `rsync`, or tracking changes with version control tooling like
`git`.



# META OPTIONS AND COMMANDS

`--help`
: Show list of command-line options.

`version`
: Show version of snipple.
